A thousand years ago, there was a very huge empire. The empire had a wise king and people are living in peace. One day, they received a message from another country. They sent out a messenger to that country.
"Greetings," the messenger said, "I am pleased to meet you, Mr.Putin." 
"Yes, it is very good to speak with you, Mr. Messenger," said the ruler of the other country, "What would you like to speak about?"
