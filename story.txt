A thousand years ago, there was a very huge empire. The empire had a wise king and people are living in peace. One day, they received a message from another country. They sent out a messenger to that country.

"Greetings," the messenger said, "I am pleased to meet you, Mr.Putin." 
"Yes, it is very good to speak with you, Mr. Messenger," said the ruler of the other country, "What would you like to speak about?"

Mr.Putin was a greedy man and one who's goal was to accomplish power. He said to the messenger "I would like to enter into a trade agreement with you". The messenger replied asking what certain things he has to trade. Mr.Putin showed the messenger technology he had never seen before. The messenger then left with the proposition and returned to his king. Little to the messenger's knowledge, Putin's new technology has a hidden secret.

The messenger arrived back in his home country and presented the new technology to the ruler. The ruler was very pleased with the gift and adorned it to his mantle. Late that evening, the object on the mantle began to hum softly, preparing for its mission. The next morning would hold unsavory surprises for this ruler.

Accidentally, an asteriod hit the planet that these two countries are residing. The next morning never came, but the gift was intact from the massive collision. The gift began his long journey wandering in the universe.
